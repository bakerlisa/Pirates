ü•ã üèÜ 5 hour exam Full Crud exam

People, this is a feat for the Gods! Literally create a fullstack fully fuctioning project in 5 hours....Wow. Try it sometime. Its HARD! But I'm a badass and I got it done! And I may not have had enough tome to make it prestty, but take a look at the code B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L!!! 


PS I got top scores for it! To get this I had to teach myself a lot of outside work and do additional work on the exam with the same amount of time.
