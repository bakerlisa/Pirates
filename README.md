People, this is a feat for the Gods! Literally trying to create a fullstack fully fuctioning project in 5 hours....Wow. 

The only un-Godly thing I didn't get done is that the styling. I could cheat and use a CSS library, but where the fun in that. That and I love to style stuff. CSS is EASY! So I'm gonna take a few hours at some point and make this puppy B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L!!! 

*** MORE Pictures are coming! Styles are still a work in progress ****
